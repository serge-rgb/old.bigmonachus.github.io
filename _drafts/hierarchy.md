title: The Hierarchy of Programming Topics.
---

Insert paragraph explaining why this is a heirarchy

1. ***Ideas. Philosophy. The "why"***

    Why did I choose to spend my life doing game development? What are the
motivations behind a choice? What is my rationale? Regardless of your opinion of
Clojure or Lisp in general, Rich Hickey's philosophical talks are worthwile to
every programmer (and some of them to every person who solves problems for a living).
I recommend googling for "Hammock driven development"

    Why FP matters.
    The rise of worse is better.

    bleh

2. ***Design***

    Insert an example of a good article on software design. (Ericcson's anti design patterns rant?)

3. ***Algorithms and Architecture***

    Anything by rygorous. Other technical blogs. (Good) research papers.

4. ***Implementation details***

    id Software Code reviews.

5. ***Languages and Tools***

    Day-to-day flamewars. Tweets complaining about C++. Some things have value (python paradox) Explain why I hesitate to place Languages here.
