title: "Going Indie #1 -- A good start"
---

Hello! I am Sergio. Mexican. Programmer at arms. This is the first in a series of posts about "going indie". Just about everyone is an indie game developer these days. And now so am I!

Today I will treat you to a brief history of me; so if you are not interested in my carefully constructed online image, carry on, I won't mind.

# My humble beginnings

As a kid I was terrified of social interaction and I have always battled anxiety; I had to learn how to tell the time to a stranger and how to look at other people's eyes without shaking uncontrollably. Things got worse after I got to college: I missed a semester of school because of crippling anxiety attacks, including one that actually ruined Christmas! I am happily medicated now. I also meditate and exercise. I've got friends, a girlfriend, and am generally considered as a functional, if a bit odd, member of society.

I have never liked school. Ever since grade school, anything above a passing grade was seen by me as wasted effort. I was never lazy, though, I always had things to do. I like to think of myself as an overachieving underachiever.

I have always been in love with virtual worlds.

I loved to play with my (completely illegal, but come on, who can afford it?) copies of Flash and Maya. I created my share of 2D shorts and 3D models/animations. I was a Linux fanatic in middle school and I had the coolest teacher, who let me set up the infrastructure to teach other kids what FTP was; he also introduced me to Python before Paul Graham wrote "The Python Paradox"! Great teacher. I don't remember when I started programming; I remember using something called "Dark Basic" on my uncle's computer because our home PC couldn't run it, but my memory is almost useless. I didn't take programming seriously until my first couple of C and C++ projects in high school.

After high school, I decided to enroll to the closest thing Mexico has to a Computer Science curriculum at Mexico's Public University. In hindsight I should have chosen Math as my major. I don't think you can teach programming in a classroom and most interesting CS classes are also Math classes. I started college in August 2007 and I *still* have not graduated...

# Fancy Jobs

In 2010 Microsoft came to recruit interns. After a long and pleasant interviewing experience, I was recruited as an intern for the summer of 2011. In theory I was a Direct2D intern, but that year every Windows intern was put into small teams to create apps for what would become Windows 8.

Shortly after my Microsoft internship, I sent my CV to http://jobs.google.com and after a shorter interview process I got a winter internship. In 2012 I skipped a semester of school and spent 3.5 months working at YouTube. It has been the best job I have ever had.

In 2013 I was an intern at Google again and this time I was close enough to graduation that I applied for a full time job.

Google's hiring process is complicated. The last stage is the one when a hiring committee has given you its blessing and you are placed in a pool of chosen ones. An allocation team looks for a place where you fit and then they give you an offer. For some reason they never found a team for me. I haven't gotten the actual "no" from Google, but there's no reason to keep hoping for a "yes" (at the time of this writing, it has been more than six months).

# Frame of reference.

So, this year I found myself as a student who is close to graduation and soon to be in the job market, with no one waiting for me. On top of that, a technicality was making it impossible for me to graduate before summer. School was taking most of my time and just in case I haven't been clear enough, I really don't enjoy school.

Life is unreasonably short, so I decided to see the same picture with a different frame. I plan on graduating _eventually_, but I don't care when; I can dedicate 10% of my time to school and some day it will be over without having made me too miserable.

I have a small financial cushion, an Oculus DK1 (and a DK2 on the way), and some strong ideas about game design. I can work on whatever I want for the foreseeable future. This is a picture I like.

Now when people ask me what I do, I just tell them I am a programmer; I am working on mobile and virtual reality. I am a Working Man, and sometimes I have to do unpleasant things like filing taxes, going to the dentist and occasionally attending class.

Jeff Atwood said it best:

So I am going indie. I'm "embracing the suck", "doing it in public" and I am "picking the stuff that matters"

# Klay

Over the past two years I have been working on-and-off on an extremely cool 3D sculpting program for the iPad. I could link to a video or two but they don't do it justice. A nice marketing video is on the pipeline.

Klay is the name of my app. It will be the first release under my studio's name, but the next thing will most certainly be a VR application. All the paperwork is being done; soon I will have my own company and hopefully earn enough money to build the next cool thing.

I just told you my business model: Build a cool thing, and hopefully earn enough to build the next cool thing. If I fail, I can always get a real job.

Thanks for reading! Tune in next time when I write about whatever lies ahead in the path of the mexican indie game developer.
