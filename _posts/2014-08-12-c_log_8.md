title: "Captain's Log. Week 8 -- Windows"
---

I found a surprise returning from vacation. I got my DK2!

I decided to migrate to Windows instead of waiting for Linux support, so I spent a day and a half configuring the new OS.

Then I spent another day and a half porting my ray tracing code to Windows and the new Oculus SDK.

Unfortunately, I accidentally my Linux drive, so I am running tools to recover data. I had some stuff that was not backed up that I really don't want to lose...

My goal for this week is to build a 2D level editor to help with creating 2.5D prototypes. But before I start doing that I have to recover my data.

Over and out!
