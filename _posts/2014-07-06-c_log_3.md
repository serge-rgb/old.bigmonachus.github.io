*A lot of my time this week was spent dealing with bullshit related to shipping [Klay](/klay), but this series is dedicated to the next project, so I won't get into that*

I am cheating a bit, because I am writing this on a Sunday evening instead of a Monday morning.

This week started off with me wanting to get barrel distortion out of the way. After some googling, I found [this forum post](https://developer.oculusvr.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=9511#p122386) by Mr. Tom Forsyth. I was a bit dismayed -- I thought that the correction function would be a 4-line solution, and here we had one of Oculus's head technical honchos recommending that we generate a distortion mesh via the SDK in order to get the distortion values for each pixel.

I had gotten to the point where I had generated the distortion meshes (one for each eye) and extracted the data. If my memory serves me, and it usually doesn't, the SDK creates a 64x64 mesh, and the output texture would be the size of the viewport in pixels. So the next logical step was to write to a texture doing bilinear interpolation from the mesh data. While doable, this kind of code is usually the kind where I mess up, so in a flash of lazyness I took a detour and implemented the 4-line solution, just to see.

It worked surprisingly well.

The barrel distortion is explained clearly in the docs of SDK v0.2, and there is a [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_distortion#Software_correction) about it. For the Rift, ignore the second term in the equation, we just care about the constants K0, K1, ...

So after playing with the constants a bit, I ended up with my originally expected 4 line solution and happily threw all the mesh-gen code away. The solution is not perfect; the constants are defined as "whatever makes Sergio see straight lines", but that solution makes me happier than the "generate two heavyweight data structures and interpolate" solution, even if the latter is "correct". Pfft. Correctness is over-rated.

One happy side-effect is that while doing the mesh generation stuff, I mostly switched to the Oculus C API. Being in my "f\*\*\* everything about C++" stage, I find the C API much more pleasant than the C++ API.

Following that, I just pulled a lambert function out of my left pocket.

I had a really hard time with box collision. It was one of those "I suck so hard. Why did I choose this line of work" kind of situations. I wasn't getting the normals right, code that was working suddenly exploded, and of course there was no decent debugger because this is GLSL and the gods hate us and nothing really matters.

I banged my stupid head against the wall until everything worked. Now it is pretty and it is correct and it makes me smile.

This week I am sticking to my length-limit, so I won't blab on about having fun doing low-level optimization of my triangle-drawing routines, but I will say that I really need to pick an acceleration structure, because shadows (as expected) made the framerate explode: the demo you see above is already pretty close to the 75hz limit, running on my GTX 770. I also spent quite a lot of time doing using my mind-brains to come up with a prototype game idea that justifies my crazy ray tracing experiments. Because I hit the word-limit, I will just leave a not-so-pretty picture:

Thanks for reading!
