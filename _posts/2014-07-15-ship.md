title: "Going Indie #3 -- Just Ship It (Value and Evil)"
---

When I login to "iTunes Connect" I see two things: a "Ready for Sale" text and a little green light right next to it. Those things are letting me know that there is nothing between [Klay](/klay) and the market, other than me.

For almost a month I had been happily making progress on my new, exciting, and completely unrelated project; Getting my app approved made me grind to a halt. The plan was to do some PR, ship the app, and then get back to work on the new thing. This is not what has happened.

Before now, I believed that I was procrastinating; I have been binge-watching Doctor Who episodes instead of doing anything resembling work. Just now, I have realized that in reality I am simply paralyzed with fear.

There is a whole universe out there if you go out looking up how to make money on the app store. One would think that it is as simple as sticking an app in one side and then seeing money come out of the other end, but the Internet says otherwise.

Spend one second looking for marketing tips and you will find out about all the hype that you should have created long ago, too late now, you idiot; the importance of choosing the right search keywords, and all the affordable and convenient products that can help you choose them; the absolute necessity of having strong reviews come out at exactly the same time as the release of your app. There are countless bits of marketing and PR that you have to get right if you want to survive for even an instant in the monster-infested sea that is the Apple App Store.

At least that is how my fear-filled mind-brains were seeing things. I think I have a clearer picture now.

Visualize two orthogonal axes: One representing Value, and the other representing Evil. I could have chosen other names but I chose Value and Evil, you can't stop me. It's done.

"Value" represents how much value you give to the world. If you solve a problem that a lot of people were having then you have extremely high value. If you are a game, value represents whatever subjective values each of us thinks makes a game "good". I think we can all agree that "Clash of Clans" is shit, so I will pick that game as "Low Value".

"Evil" is how many tactics you use to get your product noticed by other humans. All products are a little bit evil, I don't know of any who aren't evil because if I know about a product, there was effort and intent placed to make me know about it. This is the definition of Evil for the scope of this article. I choose a strong word because marketing tactics tend towards the manipulative and dishonest. I think we can all still agree that "Clash of Clans" is a steaming heap of shit, so I will pick that game as "High Evil".

Anything by the dude who created crayon physics is high value-low evil.

Bioshock is high value-high evil. I think we can all agree that BioShock is a good game and that there was also a lot of marketing involved to get it to sell many, many copies.

Low-value-low-evil is the shitty tetris clone that I made for my feature phone. Thankfully, it was lost in time.

There is nothing wrong in my book with any of the above categories. Now, the fourth...

Low-value. High-evil

There are tons of people who sort-of-learn Objective C and hack together a not so well made piece of software to make some money. The bulk of the information and tips you will find are catered to this audience.

The incompetent fuck who made the ten hundred thousandth angry birds clone finds it very useful to choose the right keywords so he shows up higher in search. The weekend coder who wrote a crappy whack-a-mole game will maybe benefit from whatever advice he can pick up from that app store marketing blog written by that dude who created a truly hilarious fart app that got to the top of the Latvian app store.

Finally, I have reached the point:

I believe that I have created [something of value](/klay), and this is the advice I am giving to myself and any person who is reading who might be in a situation similar to mine:

If you made a quality app, ship it.

If you have created something of value, ship it.

You can go as far as you want on the "Evil" axis. Get some reviews. Go on forums and show it to people. Go as Evil as you want, just get the Value out into the world, it really could use more of it.

The action I am taking to follow my own advice is to ship this Thursday, July 17. I will get evil after that. I will contact journalists to get reviews if I can. I am even being Evil now: I am posting this on reddit to get some exposure.

*Footnote:
Evil does not necessarily mean "Profitable". As a proof of existence: anything by Terry Cavanagh scores pretty low on Evil but is hugely profitable and full of Value.*
