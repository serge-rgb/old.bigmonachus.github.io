title: "Captain's Log. Week 5 -- Game Design is Hard. Let's go shopping!"
---

I skipped a week!

What happened was that I shipped a game. Then I spent a lot of time obsessing about it.

I have done some progress since the last Captain's Log, so I will quickly summarize it. I moved a lot of code around, mostly from GLSL to C. Starting to design an actual system instead of a tech demo. I deleted a paragraph with some very impressive tech jargon about my implementation because I passed the 500 word limit, I want to talk about something else:

I'm keeping the renderer very simple. There is a triangle pool stored in a buffer object, GL\_SHADER\_STORAGE\_BUFFER, very new stuff. I haven't found a lot of info on how this is implemented in GPUs, but from what little I have gathered, it is stored in main GPU memory and caches up to L2. Anyway, the triangle pool is not very meaningful. The brute-force method is to hit every triangle in the triangle pool for every ray, but there is no material information in the triangle pool and also it is incredibly slow. The thing that I want to do is to use an acceleration structure, and to store things like material information in the leaf nodes. I implemented Bounding Volume Heirarchies (BVH) in the CPU side, along with some validation code. The next step is to flatten the tree and make it nice and tight so that it fits in memory shared by threads. By 'thread' I mean 'warp' or 'wavefront', depending on which football team you root for. I would have written a line of two of tree-flattening code but, as I sai

I shipped a game and went all Phil Fish in Indie Game the Movie: yelling at random people, running naked, painting "In-App Purchases" in beautiful graffiti art, and so on.

I may have nothing important to report on the coding side, but I have done a lot of progress in my mind-brains.
