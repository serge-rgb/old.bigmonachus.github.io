I've been meaning to switch to a better platform than wordpress. Jekyll + Github
 pages seems great.

Luckily, virtually no one read my old blog, I nuked most of it but I am keeping
it online because there are some popular links and I *hate* broken links.

Here is what to expect:

* Technical articles
* Essays
* That's it!

I respect your time. I will keep the signal to noise ratio as high as possible.
