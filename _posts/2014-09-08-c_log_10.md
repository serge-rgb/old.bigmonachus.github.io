I started this log assuming that it would be as effective as sending emails to my dad, who acted as a proxy boss to get me to finish my iOS app.

Some experiments work and others don't. Sending emails made it possible to finish my app quickly (although it was very stressful), while these posts do not seem to make me move faster than I would without them.

I am proud of the progress I have made with my VR experiment, and I will continue blogging about it, I'm just not going to be writing weekly logs.

By the way, yesterday I glued FXAA to the ray tracer and it works great.

Over and out!

=)
