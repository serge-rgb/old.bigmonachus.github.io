title: "Captain's Log. Week 6 -- Bounding Volume Hierarchies"
---

Another slow week. And I'm going on vacation in two days, so next one will be even less productive!

Luckily, there have been good results.
The renderer is drawing almost 200,000 triangles at acceptable framerates: less than 13 milliseconds per frame at 1280x800, which is the resolution of the Oculus DK1.

*3D grid of 16,384 cubes, each made up of 12 triangles. The aliasing hurts my eyes :(*

To be honest, there are angles where performance breaks down, I'll write about that later.

The renderer data is structured in three shader storage buffers, each smaller than the previous one:

* First buffer: Triangle Pool

    Lots and lots of triangles.

* Second buffer: Primitive Pool

    A primitive holds an offset into the triangle pool, and the number of triangles to draw after the offset. For example: let's say that a primitive representing a cube is at offset 1000 and has 12 triangles; we render this primitive by rendering the subset [1000, 1012) of the triangle pool.

    Note: from my brute-force-ray-tracing testing, there is no performance loss from the extra level of indirection.

    Primitives also contain the type of material; currently the only material is the standard lambert function that we all know and love. I plan to keep the game away from being physically-based, I'm going for a flat style. I have just started following [these guys](https://twitter.com/TeamRuah) because their style is almost exactly what I had in my head (I swear to the seven gods, I am not ripping them off).

* Third buffer: BVH

    A flat representation of the Bounding Volume Heirarchy. If you don't know about flattening trees, go read about it, they may ask about it during an interview!


## BVH

A bounding volume hierarchy is a tree that holds bounding volumes, each bounding volume node may contain either other bounding volumes or a primitive.

The point of this data structure is to avoid intersecting every primitive with every ray.

The way it work is: for each ray, we traverse the tree, depth-first; leaving a branch if an intersection with a bounding box is not found, thereby avoiding every primitive below in the hierarchy. If we reach a leaf, we intersect with the primitive. That's the gist of it.

The usual bounding volume of choice is an AABB (axis-aligned-bounding-box), spheres are cheaper for intersection calculation, but AABB's wrap more tightly around the average primitive.

Building the tree is not complicated, and I chose an especially non-complicated way of building it. This method is faster than the SAH (surface area heuristic) method, which I will not explain here, but it creates trees that result in lower (or less predictable) performance; just note that SAH is the preferred way to go among the ray tracing crowd.

The method I am currently using works like this: The input is an array of primitives. Look at the centroids of the primitives, and choose the spatial axis (X, Y or Z) that has more variation. After an axis has been selected, split the array of primitives into two new arrays, and recurse. Stop when the array contains only one primitive. Before recursion, we create a node; its AABB is the one that contains the bounding volumes of every primitive in the array.

The centroid method does not create optimal trees. On my machine, the grid of cubes I posted above draws in 3 or 4 milliseconds when viewed in front, but it shoots up to more than 30ms (way above any reasonable limit for VR) when viewed from the left. I don't like to unnecessarily complicate things. Since I will never be drawing anything close to a 200,000 triangle scene, I think I'm well off with the centroid method, because it's cheap.

Actually, my next step is to make sure that the creation of the tree is really, really, smoking, ridiculously fast. I want to update the tree every frame.  There probably needs to be an "update" function that modifies the tree when a single primitive changes, but if possible, just resetting the tree every frame would be preferable. I believe that it is perfectly possible, we've got CPU-power coming out of our ears these days.

I hope that the performance unpredictability of the approach doesn't turn out to be a problem. I am speculating, but when I introduce non-primary rays, like shadow rays, I believe the performance drop will be a stabilizing force.

My next-next step is to make a prototype. As they say, "write games, not engines". It seems like it's finally time to write game code! I mean, we need collision code and I want to make the gamepad work and I always roll my own mesh loading code and who knows what horrible problem might be lurking in the darkness, but I would really like to have a prototype.

See you in two weeks! Vacation time...
