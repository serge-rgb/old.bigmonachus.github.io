title: "Going Indie #2 -- Holy shit"
---

Deciding to "go indie" and go off on my own on a marathonic quest was a carefully taken decision. I have a history of making impulsive and stupid decisions; this one was not impulsive.

There have been a couple of unforeseen surprises. The first one was my mother going apeshit.

If you haven't seen Trainspotting, i suggest that you stop reading this and fix that immediately. If you have seen Trainspotting, then you certainly remember the best intro sequence in cinematic history.

I have been chasing the proverbial carrot ever since I got my first prestigious internship. Being part of a very exclusive institution is a powerfully addictive drug.

My mom was very comforted with the idea of having a son working at a well known and prestigious company; my decision to put college, and possibly a job at BigCo, on hold was a big blow to her. I did not expect her to react so strongly, to be angry and disappointed. It took me a while to explain my reasons articulately enough to convince her that what I am doing makes sense. It also took her a while to accept it.

The second surprise was that being one's own boss is actually hard.

Not having a boss has its own bucket of surprises. When I work for someone, I work hard; I measure my output and take actions to keep it constant after I find the sweet spot between boss-pleasing and burnout-avoidance. Being my own boss is strange. After telling my girlfriend for the first time that I couldn't see her because I had work to do, I saw the problem: How do I divide my time? The risk of burnout is real, the risk of losing my relationship is real. On the other hand, the risk of pulling a year-long netflix binge is also very real. Other risks exist, like burning my savings on luxuries, dinners and gifts.

Luckily, I found an elegant solution. It started by me sending weekly email reports to my dad, who agreed to be my proxy boss. The point of the experiment was to have someone to report my progress to.
This solution evolved into a very simple system. I use one half of my whiteboard to place postits. Every week I fill the TO-DO side, and I move it to the DONE side as I progress. Ideally, by the end of the week, the DONE side is empty.

NO THIS IS NOT SCRUM SHUT UP GO AWAY I HATE THE WORD AGILE

I am slowly gaining momentum, and I am very happy with my progress so far. It is all about balance; Choose reasonable To-Do items to keep myself challenged but also set a limit so that free time appears naturally. It also helps that I have an awesome girlfriend. I don't think my friends feel neglected (post complaints in the comments?)
