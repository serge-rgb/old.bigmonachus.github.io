title: "Captain's Log. Week 2 -- GPGPU"

[Klay](/klay) is waiting for review. Not much more on that front. There was a little problem with me setting it as "Made for Kids": There is no restriction in place for sending email and posting on Facebook. I don't want to place a dialog asking daddy for permission to send email, so the app is now not in the "Made for Kids" zone, even though kids love it.

# Project TARDIS

My new project is a game built on the idea of warping space. It is inspired by the TARDIS, from Doctor Who. The first demo will be a small room containing a phone booth. Once you step inside the phone booth, the player will realise that the inside is huge.

If the first demo is mind-blowing enough, I will experiment with different game ideas to see which one I like best. I have a couple of ideas but it is hard to tell what is going to be fun just by drawing on paper or by simply imagining.

# Starting is fun!

After a more than a month of finishing work, it has been like a glass of cold water in the desert to start something new.

*Mercurial or Git?*

*C++? C? Go? D? Rust?*

*OpenCL or GLSL?*

*Let's try [vogl](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/vogl), maybe it is already way better than apitrace. (Honestly, on Linux with an NVidia card, and even though it is closed source and deprecated, gDEBugger is still the best GL debugger.)*

I learned Hg just for variety. I have been a Git user for years, and even then switching to Mercurial felt like *leaving* the dark side. I like the immutability of it. I like that the design is simple. I'm happy with it. It treats me well.

Regarding languages: Any of the systems languages I mentioned would suffice, but I ended up with bare C, taking the useful features of C++ that are orthogonal to each other. Namespaces, auto, polymorphism, templates (restricted to allow "generics") and that's it. Classes and RAII didn't make the cut.

**Aside:** There's all kinds of C++ styles in the Klay source. Mostly is Google-style, which is what you end up with if you follow the Google style guide. There is also bare-C with some C++ and some over-engineered crap with virtual methods running amok. I tried everything, experimented with things that I am ashamed of. It was like the US college experience, but in C++.

I love Go, so I implemented garbage-collected slices. For the past month or so I've been reading a lot about the Boehm Garbage Collector. Finally I decided to use it. At least I will have a story to tell in the end.

This new coding style is essentially C taking enough features from C++ to take it in the Go direction. Now it feels like I'm coding in Go with shitty generics. I love it! It even has some things that I miss when trying out Go, like having a clear distinction between stack and heap variables, so to not abuse the GC. A lot of the times I just want a quick malloc/free inside a small scope. I can do that. The compiler is cool with it. I can switch to automatic transmission whenever I want, like when when dealing with strings. I don't have a goroutine equivalent, but I don't expect to be doing a lot of multi-core programming. All the parallel stuff is being done in the GPU, which leads me to...

GPGPU!

I was undecided. OpenCL is sort-of-widely supported. GLSL compute shaders are available only in GL versions >= 4.3 and not everyone has a card that supports GL 4.3. In the end I said "meh.. This is a VR-only game. If you have an Oculus, you have a card that supports GL 4.3". GLSL it is.

**Aside:** Starting from scratch, I decided to avoid every OpenGL reference *other* than the oficial GL/GLSL specs. I would not recommend this for beginners, but it was interesting and I ended up with better code.

My goal for the weekend was to get a bouncing ball rendering (with ray tracing, duh) on the rift. I am happy to report that I succeded. Actually, scratch that... I still need to implement distortion correction, but that's pretty easy, you just change the direction of each ray according to the distortion function, and you can get the distortion function just by looking at the Oculus code.

I wrote a simple Python renderer with Oculus support 6 months ago, and seeing how much they changed the API since then was surprising. The docs are more hand-holdy. They do not include tips for writing your humble pixel shader. They have switched to a more complicated mesh-based approach (presumably to implement Carmack's time warping?). The header files were more useful to help me get the information that I wanted to render in stereo.

*The circle is an arbitrary barrier, to avoid drawing some pixels that most people would never see. The barrel shaped outline you see in raster-based Oculus apps is a framebuffer being deformed.*

I had more to say, but I have already way more than overshot my 500 word limit on "captain's logs". I could have been a lot more productive this week, but it was my mom's birthday and we had a lot of parties. You can say what you want about mexicans but we know how to celebrate a birthday.
All the decisions I described were taken long ago, while I was day-dreaming of greener pastures in the shower when working on Klay. This week began with implementing slices and ended with the bouncing ray-traced ball. I'm happy with that :)

Thanks for reading. See you next week!
